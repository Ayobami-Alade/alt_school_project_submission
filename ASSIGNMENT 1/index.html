          <strong><i>Transition to Technology:</i></strong> In addition to my
          work in pharmacy, I am embarking on a new journey in frontend
          development through AltSchool's School of Engineering program. This
          decision stems from my desire to leverage technology to solve complex
          healthcare problems. I believe that understanding and utilizing modern
          web technologies will enable me to create innovative solutions that
          enhance patient care and streamline healthcare processes.
